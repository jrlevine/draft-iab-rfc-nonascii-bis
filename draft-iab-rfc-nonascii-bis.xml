 <abstract>
   <t>
In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more
diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for 
the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the 
required language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will
be in UTF-8, allowing for a broader range of characters than typically
used in the English language.  This document describes the RFC Editor 
requirements and guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.
   </t>
   <t>
This document updates RFC 7322. Please review the PDF version of this draft.

 </abstract>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
Please review the PDF version of this draft. 
</t>
<t>
For much of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding used
for RFCs has been <xref target="RFC0020">ASCII</xref>.  
This was a sensible choice at the time: the language of the Series has
always been English, a language that primarily uses ASCII-encoded characters 
(ignoring for a moment words borrowed from more richly decorated alphabets); 
and, ASCII is the "lowest common denominator" for character encoding, making 
cross-platform viewing trivial.
</t>
<t>
There are limits to ASCII, however, that hinder its continued use as the
exclusive character encoding for the Series.  The increasing need for 
easily readable, internationalized content suggests it is time to allow 
non-ASCII characters in RFCs where necessary.  To support this move away 
from ASCII, RFCs will switch to supporting UTF-8 as the default character 
encoding and allow support for a broad range of Unicode character support. 
<xref target="UnicodeCurrent"/>  Note that the RFC Editor may reject any 
codepoint that does not render adequately in enough formats or on in enough 
rendering engines using the current tooling.
</t>
<t>
Given the continuing goal of maximum readability across platforms, the
use of non-ASCII characters should be limited in a document to only where 
necessary within the text.  This document describes the rules under which 
non-ASCII characters may be used in an RFC.  These rules will be applied 
as the necessary changes are made to submission checking and editorial
tools.
</t>
<t>
This document updates the <xref target="RFC7322">RFC Style Guide</xref>.
</t>
<t>The details described in this document are expected to change based on experience gained in implementing the RFC production center's toolset. Revised documents will be published capturing those changes as the toolset is completed. Other implementers must not expect those changes to remain backwards-compatible with the details described in this document.</t>


</section>

<section title="Basic Requirements">
<t>
Two fundamental requirements inform the guidance and examples provided
in this document.  They are:
</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Searches against RFC indexes and database tables need to return
expected results and support appropriate Unicode string matching
behaviors; </t>

  <t>RFCs must be able to display correctly across a wide range of
readers and browsers.  People whose systems do not have the fonts needed to
display a particular RFC need to be able to read the various publication 
formats and the XML correctly in order to understand and implement the 
information described in the document.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Rules for the Use of Non-ASCII Characters">
<t>
This section describes the guidelines for the use of non-ASCII characters 
in an RFC.  If the RFC Editor identifies areas where the use of non-ASCII 
characters negatively impacts 
the readability of the text, they will request alternate text.
</t>
<t>
The RFC Editor may, in cases of entire words represented in non-ASCII
characters, ask for a set of reviewers to verify the meaning, spelling, 
characters, and grammar of the text.
</t>

<section title="General Usage Throughout a Document">
<t>
Where the use of non-ASCII characters is purely as part of an example
and not otherwise required for correct protocol operation, escaping 
the non-ASCII character is not required.  Note, however, that as the 
language of the RFC Series is English, the use of non-ASCII characters 
is based on the spelling of words commonly used in the English language 
following the guidance in the <xref target="MerrWeb">Merriam-Webster 
dictionary</xref>. 
</t>
<t>
The RFC Editor will use the primary spelling listed in that dictionary
by default.
</t>
<t>Example of non-ASCII characters that do not require escaping
(the example from Section 3.1.1.12 of RFC4475, with a hex dump
replaced by the actual character glyphs) <xref target="RFC4475"/>:

<section title="Person Names">
<t>
Person names may appear in several places within an RFC. When a script 
outside the Unicode Latin blocks is used for a person name, an
author-provided, ASCII-only identifier will appear immediately after the
non-Latin characters, surrounded by parentheses. This will improve general
readability of the text. <xref target="UNICODE-CHART"/>.

<t>Example of proper identification of Unicode

<t> Preferred: </t>

  <t>Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are

  <t>Temperature changes in the Temperature Control Protocol are

<t>
Which option of (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) is preferred may depend
on context and the specific character(s) in question.  All are acceptable 
within an RFC.  BCP 137, "ASCII Escaping of Unicode Character" describes 
the pros and cons of different options for identifying Unicode characters 
in an ASCII document <xref target="BCP137">BCP137</xref>.

<section title="Tables">
<t>
Tables follow the same rules for identifiers and characters as in

understandable for a reader) for a given document to have two tables -- 
one including the identifiers and non-ASCII characters and a second with 
just the non-ASCII characters -- that will be allowed on a case-by-case 
basis.

<section title="Code Components">
<t>
The RFC Editor encourages the use of the U+ notation except within a
code component where you must follow the rules of the programming
language in which you are writing the code.
</t>
<t>
Code components are generally expected to use fixed-width fonts. Where
such fonts are not available for a particular script, the best script-
appropriate font will be used for that part of the code component.

<section title="Bibliographic Text">
<t>
The reference entry must be in English; whatever subfields are present
must be available in ASCII-encoded characters. For references to RFCs
and Internet Drafts, the author's name will be included in the reference
as listed on the front header of the RFC or Internet Draft. As long as 
good sense is used, the reference entry may also include non-ASCII 
characters at the author's discretion and as provided by the author.  
The RFC Editor may request a review of any non-ASCII reference entry.

This applies to both normative and informative references.
